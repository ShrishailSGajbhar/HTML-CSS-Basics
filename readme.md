* Anatomy of a webpage:
    * `HTML`: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is resposible for the structure of a webpage
    * `CSS`: Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is responsible for styling of the webpage
    * `Javascript`: acts as brain responsible for the interactivity of the webpage
* A CSS class rule will win over an element rule.
* Inheritance is a powerful feature in CSS where child elements inherit the style specifics from the parent elements eliminating the need of restating the rules for child elements.
* For browser speed and maintainance purpose the style elements are specified in a separate sheet having .css extension.
* List styles are helpful for styling multiple elements at once
* You can also create and test different styles in real time using your browser directly.
* Use [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) to check the browser support of css rules
